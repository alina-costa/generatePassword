# Password Generator

This project generates a random password that only includes character types that the user wants to be included. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a series of questions will appear as prompts to ask the user how long they want the password to be, and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the generated password.

The randomized password will then appear inside the box in place of the "Your Secure Password" text.
